					<p>Personal data means any information relating to an individual which can identify them, either directly or indirectly.  It can refer, amongst other things to an identification number, or to one or more specific identifying pieces of data, such as an address or date of birth.</p>
					<p>We collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store personal data when needed to provide our service and for our operational and business purposes as described in this policy. We want to be clear about our privacy practices so that you can make informed choices about the use of your data, and we encourage you to contact us at any time with questions or concerns.</p>
					<p>If you have placed an order through us, we will have your name, email address, telephone number and the method you chose to make your purchase with. We will also obtain personal data when you contact us for any reason, sign up to a service, download or register to use the app or report a problem with our services. </p>
					<p>In addition, our servers, logs, and other technologies <span style="text-decoration: underline;">automatically collect certain information</span> (see below) to help us administer, protect, and improve our services; analyse usage; and improve customers’ experience. </p>
					<p>We share personal data with others only as described in this policy, or when we believe that the law permits or requires it.</p>
					<h5>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY</h5>
					<p><b>Cookies:</b> We may monitor your use of the Platform <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through the use of cookies</span> and similar tracking devices. For example, we may monitor how many times you use the Platform and which pages you go to. This information helps us to build a profile of our customers. Some of this data will be aggregated or statistical, which means that we will not be able to identify you individually. </p>
					<p><b>Device information: </b> We may also collect information about your device each time you use the Platform.

					<h5>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h5>

					<ul class="pp">
						<li>To allow us to handle your orders and process your payments and refunds.</li>

						<li>To update our records and generally maintain your account with us.</li>
						<li>To keep a record of when and why you contact us and to keep your contact details up-to-date.</li>

						<li>share data with third parties (including those in the food, drink, leisure, marketing and advertising sectors) to use your data in order to let you know about goods and services which may be of interest to you (by post, telephone, mobile messaging (e.g. SMS, MMS etc.).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Please note that by submitting reviews regarding the Platform, service and/or kiosks, you consent to us using such reviews on the Platform and in any marketing or advertising materials created by us or on our behalf.

					<p>The personal data you submit to us will only be retained for as long as is required for the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law.</p>

Where such disclosures are made, this will be under contractual arrangements with us and carried out in accordance with the requirements of UK and EU data protection laws. </p>
					<p>We may disclose your personal data to any successors in title to our business or to a buyer in the event that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we or any of our assets are acquired by a third party</span> (as your data may be one of the transferring assets).</p>
